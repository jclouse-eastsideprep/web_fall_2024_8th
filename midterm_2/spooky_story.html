<p style="font-size: 50px; text-align: center;">Welcome to my spooky story! I hope you like it!</p>
<h1 style="text-align: center; font-size: 35px;">The Lantern Keeper</h1>
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 25px;">
    In a small, fog-shrouded town nestled in the shadows of an ancient forest, there stood an old, crumbling graveyard. Local lore whispered that on Halloween night, an eerie figure known as the Lantern Keeper would appear. He was said to carry an iron lantern that glowed with an unsettling, ghostly blue flame. No one knew who—or what—he was. But everyone knew one rule: if you saw him, you were never to look directly into the lantern.
</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 25px;">One particularly chilly Halloween, three friends—Ava, Aksel, and Lena—decided to test their courage by venturing into the graveyard at midnight. They each carried flashlights, though their beams barely pierced the thick, swirling mist. The tombstones rose like crooked teeth from the earth, casting long shadows that seemed to move whenever the friends turned their backs.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 25px;">As they reached the heart of the graveyard, a strange chill passed over them. The mist thickened, and the world fell into silence—no rustling leaves, no chirping crickets, just the hollow sound of their own breath.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 25px;">Then they heard it: a slow, steady clink, clink, clink of metal echoing through the mist. Ava, whose curiosity often led her into trouble, tightened her grip on her flashlight and took a few cautious steps forward. The sound grew louder, closer, and a faint blue glow flickered through the fog.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 25px;">"Let’s go back," Aksel whispered, his voice quivering.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 25px;">But it was too late. Emerging from the mist was the figure of a tall man cloaked in black, his hood shadowing his face. In his hand, he held a rusted iron lantern, the eerie blue flame licking the glass with a life of its own. The Lantern Keeper.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 25px;">They froze as the Lantern Keeper turned toward them. The flame’s light seemed to grow stronger, casting an unnatural glow across the gravestones and their pale, terrified faces. The Keeper raised his lantern, pointing it directly at Ava.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 25px;">Against every instinct, Ava’s eyes were drawn to the flame. She could have sworn she saw shadows moving within it—no, not shadows. Faces. Screaming faces.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 25px;">A terrible cold spread over her, sinking into her bones. She tried to scream, but her voice was stolen by the silence. The flame flickered, and her vision blurred until all she saw was darkness.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 25px;">The next morning, only two backpacks were found at the edge of the graveyard, covered in dew. Aksel and Lena had stumbled out at dawn, shaken and pale. When asked about Ava, they could only mutter about a lantern, shadows, and screams, their memories fractured and foggy. As for Ava…she was never seen again.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 25px;">The townsfolk added a new rule after that night. If you enter the graveyard and see the Lantern Keeper, don’t just avoid his lantern. Don’t even breathe.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 25px;">For those who breathe in the lantern’s flame, they say, are claimed by the Keeper—forever wandering the graveyard, their voices trapped in the flickering blue fire for all eternity.</p>
